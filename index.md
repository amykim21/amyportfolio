### ToDo List
[github link](https://github.com/amykim21/mern-creative-project) 

Used the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) to create a to-do list where users can login, logout, add/edit/delete tasks, add a question-and-answer item, and navigate to any day. Lists were saved in the MongoDB database.


### Visualization Applet for a Computational Geometry Algorithm

[project link](https://amykim21.github.io/)

Used HTML, Javascript, CSS, and Github Pages to create a website which visualizes the Graham Scan Algorithm through animation.
A user is able to draw points by clicking on the primal plane, and the corresponding dual line will automatically appear on the dual plane. The user can view step-by-step animations of the upper or lower hull. When the user shows the entire convex hull, the corresponding upper and lower envelopes appear on the dual plane.


### Web Browser Chatroom
[github link](https://github.com/amykim21/node-socket-chatroom)

Used Node.JS and Socket.IO to create a chatroom where multiple users can create and delete chatrooms, chat with other users, and kick or ban other users.
